Welcome to cipher day!
write a program that can encrypt texts with an alphabetical caesar cipher. This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace.
for extra credit, add a "decrypt" function to your program!


Jwartick notes:
. encrypt: shift right by 3
> abc, xyz
. decrypt: shift left by 3
> def, abc
